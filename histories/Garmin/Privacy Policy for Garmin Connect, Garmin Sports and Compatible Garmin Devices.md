==============================================================================

Last Updated: June 5, 2020

_[Review Previous Policy](https://www8.garmin.com/privacy/connect_privacy.pdf)_

Your privacy is important to Garmin. We developed this Privacy Policy to provide you with information on how we process your personal data when you use the Garmin Connect website, the Garmin Connect Mobile app, the Garmin Sports website and app, and Garmin wearable devices or other Garmin devices that are compatible with Garmin Connect.

Other Garmin websites, apps and products that do not include a link to this Privacy Policy and include a link to a different Garmin privacy policy are governed by that privacy policy. For example, we have a separate privacy statement that applies to our [Garmin Pay](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/privacy/garminpay/policy/) service.

“Personal data” is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
===============================================

Personal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address and name. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.

> ### Purposes and Legal Grounds:
> 
> (a) Garmin processes your email address because you use your email address and your password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is based on Garmin’s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.
> 
> (b) Garmin also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, apps or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile, and is displayed to your Connections when you engage in Challenges, Leaderboards, Groups and Segments, and when you submit comments. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, apps or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy, and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other Garmin Connect users.
> 
> (c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from Garmin, Garmin will also process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about Garmin products and apps. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your [preferences](https://www.garmin.com/account/ "MyPreferences") in your Garmin account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from Garmin are based on the preferences you provide in your Garmin account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your Garmin account, and any subscriptions included in your Garmin account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.
> 
> (d) If you provide your opt-in consent, Garmin will process your email address for the purpose of sending you notifications (e.g., when you join a Challenge, when a Challenge is over, when comments to a Challenge are submitted, etc.). The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You can withdraw this consent at any time by opting-out of receiving such notifications.
> 
> (e) Garmin also processes your email address to associate it with your Garmin account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.

Personal data that is processed when you sign in to your Garmin account with Social Media Credentials if you choose (China only):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you live in China, you may choose to sign in to your Garmin account using your social media sign in credentials (e.g., your WeChat or QQ sign in credentials). If you choose this method, the first time you sign in, you will be asked whether you agree to the social media provider delivering certain information to Garmin, such as your name, email address, profile photo, posts, comments and other information associated with your social media account.

All of this information is made available to Garmin by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-on configuration works. However, the only information Garmin retains and processes is your email address. If you do not want your information to be shared with Garmin by the social media provider, then you can simply sign in to your Garmin account using your Garmin account credentials instead of your social media account credentials.

> ### PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
> 
> Garmin associates the email address provided by the social media provider with your Garmin account so that you can use your email address to sign in to your Garmin account in the future if you no longer wish to sign in using your social media account credentials. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing you an alternative sign in method and in securing your account.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can add additional information to your profile, such as your location, types of activities you participate in (e.g., running, hiking, cycling, golf, etc.), and your gender, birthdate, height and weight.

Your activities and activity data associated with your Garmin account are set to “Private” by default. You may decide to allow others to view your activities and activity data by changing the privacy settings in your Garmin account. You can join Groups and make Connections with other Garmin Connect users. You may also choose to join other Garmin Connect users in Challenges and Leaderboards. When you interact with others in these ways, you will be displaying your data relating to the Challenge or Leaderboard (e.g., aggregate number of steps during the duration of a steps Leaderboard or Challenge) even if your privacy settings in your Garmin account are set to “Private.”

Your LiveTrack invitees:
------------------------

LiveTrack is a feature available on some Garmin devices that enables you to send a link to people of your choice that allows them to see the real-time location of your device. Because anyone with access to the link will be able to see the real-time location of your Garmin device, you should use caution in determining to whom you want to send the link and be sure that you trust them to not send the link to others whom you do not want to be able to view the location of your Garmin device.

Your emergency contacts:
------------------------

If you provide emergency contacts to Garmin to be used in the event that an accident is detected or reported and you are involved in an incident that is detected by your Garmin device, we will send a notification with information about the incident, such as location, to your chosen emergency contacts via SMS or email.

Content or feature providers; other third parties:
--------------------------------------------------

From time to time, we share or sell activity data in a de-identified and aggregated manner with or to companies that provide Garmin and our customers with content or features for the purpose of enhancing the quality of the content or features they provide, and with or to other third parties for research or other purposes.

Third-party app, platform or service providers with whom you ask Garmin to share your data:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you choose to authorize Garmin to permit a third party, such as your wellness program provider, or an app, such as MyFitnessPal, Strava, or TrainingPeaks, to access your activity data in your Garmin account, then we will share such data with the third party. We will not do this without your explicit consent. Once you direct us to share data with a third party, the third party’s handling of your personal data is the responsibility of that third party and you should carefully review the third party’s privacy policy. You can choose to stop sharing data with the third-party app, platform or service provider at any time within your Garmin account.

Other service providers:
------------------------

Garmin uses cloud services from third parties such as Adobe and Emarsys to assist in sending emails. Those services track the activities associated with these emails, such as whether they were opened, whether links in the emails were clicked on, and whether purchases were made following clicks on those links. Garmin uses this data to analyze the level of engagement with its emails. Garmin uses third-party service providers to help us better understand usage of Garmin Express and the Garmin Connect website and app, and for related purposes.
