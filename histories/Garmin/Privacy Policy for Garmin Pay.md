PRIVACY POLICY FOR GARMIN PAY
=============================

Last Updated: March 10, 2020

Your privacy is important to Garmin. We developed this Privacy Policy so you know how we process your personal data when you use our Garmin Pay service. In this Privacy Policy, references to “Garmin Pay wallet” are intended to apply to the wallet on your Garmin device or, if applicable, on your third-party device, which might use a name other than Garmin Pay.

Other Garmin websites, apps and products that do not include a link to this privacy policy and include a link to a different Garmin privacy policy are governed by that privacy policy. For example, we have a separate [privacy statement that applies to Garmin Connect](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/privacy/connect/policy/ "privacy statement that applies to Garmin Connect") and its compatible wearables and other devices.

“Personal data” is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
===============================================

Personal data that is processed when you set up a Garmin Pay wallet:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When you set up a Garmin Pay wallet, we collect user information, such as first name and last name and an authentication token and, when Garmin Pay will be used on a third-party device, a username and email address. We also collect device information, such as serial number, model (device and phone), identifier, firmware version, and operating system.

> ### PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
> 
> (a) Garmin processes your first name, last name, and authentication token to use for authentication purposes. The legal ground for processing your first name, last name, and authentication token for this purpose is based on Garmin’s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your Garmin Pay wallet.
> 
> (b) For third-party device users, Garmin processes your username and email address because you use this information to sign in to your Garmin Pay wallet. The legal ground for processing your username and email address for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your Garmin Pay wallet.
> 
> (c) Garmin also processes your username and email address for use in fraud detection measures. The legal ground for processing your username and email address for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in detecting and preventing fraud and to comply with the requirements of issuing banks and payment networks.
> 
> (d) For customers using Garmin Pay on a Garmin device, Garmin also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin Pay wallet or material changes to this privacy policy. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing you important information about your Garmin Pay wallet or material changes to this privacy policy.

Personal data that is processed when you add payment methods in your Garmin Pay wallet:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you add a payment method to your Garmin Pay wallet, we collect your first name, last name, billing address, and payment information — such as the card number, expiration date, and CVV — and any other information that the issuing bank or payment network may require to verify your identity or device.

> ### PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
> 
> (a) We process this information to validate your identity with the issuing bank or payment network as per their requirements. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in protecting our customers from fraud.
> 
> (b) We also process this information so the issuing bank or payment network can validate the card and generate the payment token for use in the Garmin Pay wallet. Once this payment token is generated, we store it and other card information, such as the last four digits of the card number, the name on the card, credit card art, card type, and billing address. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is contractual necessity.

Personal data that is processed when you view, suspend, or delete payment methods in your Garmin Pay wallet:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to view a payment method in your Garmin Pay wallet, we will show you the stored card information, specifically the last four digits of the card number, the name on the card, credit card art, card type, and billing address. When you choose to suspend a payment method in your Garmin Pay wallet, we will retain the stored card information. However, we will notify the issuing bank or payment network to block it from making purchases. When you choose to remove a payment method from your Garmin Pay wallet, we will delete the stored card information as requested and notify the issuing bank or payment network to block it from making purchases.

> ### PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
> 
> We process this information to fulfill your requested actions. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is contractual necessity.

Personal data that is processed when you make a purchase using your Garmin Pay wallet:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use your Garmin Pay wallet to make a purchase, your payment token is presented to the vendor’s point-of-sale system. After the transaction is completed, at the discretion of the issuing bank or payment network, Garmin may receive confirmation of the successful payment.

> ### PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
> 
> The payment token is provided to the vendor, which will send the information to the issuing bank or payment network to process the payment. The issuing bank or payment network sends confirmation of the successful payment to Garmin so that the Garmin Pay service can send a push notification to you about the completed payment. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is contractual necessity.

Personal data that is processed when you use Garmin Pay with your transport pass:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use your Garmin Pay wallet to facilitate usage of your transport pass for express payment, information such as SEID, account ID, name, gender, and mobile phone is shared with the transportation network to process the transport use or payment, as applicable.

> ### PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
> 
> This information is provided to the transportation network to provide customer service. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is contractual necessity.

Categories of Recipients of Personal Data

To provide the Garmin Pay service, Garmin will share information with issuing banks, payment networks, card issuers, and transportation providers or related partners (such as Suica or Japan Railway East (JRE)) as needed for purposes of fraud detection, obtaining a payment token representing your credit card, and displaying transaction information.
