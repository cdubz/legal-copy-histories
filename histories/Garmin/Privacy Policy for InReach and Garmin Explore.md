Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
===============================================

### Personal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:

When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address and name. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.

> Purposes and Legal Grounds:
> ---------------------------
> 
> (a) Garmin Services processes your email address because you use your email address and your password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is based on Garmin’s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.
> 
> (b) Garmin also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your devices, apps, subscription or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your Garmin account. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is based on Garmin’s legitimate interests in providing you important information about your devices, apps, subscription or account.
> 
> (c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from Garmin, Garmin will also process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about Garmin products and apps. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your [preferences](https://www.garmin.com/account/ "MyPreferences") in your Garmin account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from Garmin are based on the preferences you provide in your Garmin account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your Garmin account, and any subscriptions included in your Garmin account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.
> 
> (d) Garmin also processes your email address to associate it with your Garmin account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.

### Personal data that is processed when you purchase a subscription to the InReach satellite communication services:

When you purchase an inReach subscription, Garmin Services collects your email address, mailing address, billing address, telephone number, and contact information for your chosen emergency contacts. A third party, WorldPay, processes your payment card information when you purchase a subscription to the inReach satellite communication services. We recommend you carefully review [WorldPay’s Privacy Policy](https://www.worldpay.com/uk/worldpay-privacy-notice "WorldPay Privacy Policy").

> (b) Garmin Services processes your mailing address because GEOS and the GEOS International Emergency Response Coordination Center (the “IERCC”) use the mailing addresses of inReach subscribers to determine if the SOS button has been activated inadvertently by a subscriber at his or her residence.

The legal ground for this processing is Garmin Service’s legitimate interest in communicating with your chosen emergency contacts in the event you are involved in an emergency situation.
>
