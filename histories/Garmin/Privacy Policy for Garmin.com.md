Privacy Policy
==============

Last Updated: June 5, 2020

_[Review Previous Policy](https://www8.garmin.com/privacy/garmin_privacy.pdf)_

Your privacy is important to Garmin. We developed this Privacy Policy to provide you with information on how we process your personal data when you create a Garmin account, interact with our customer support specialists, make a purchase in one of our stores, visit Garmin.com or other Garmin websites or use Garmin apps that include a link to this Privacy Policy.

Other Garmin websites, apps and products that do not include a link to this Privacy Policy and include a link to a different Garmin privacy policy are governed by that privacy policy. For example, we have a separate [privacy statement that applies to Garmin Connect](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/privacy/connect/policy/ "Garmin Connect Privacy Policy") and its compatible wearables and other devices.

“Personal data” is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
===============================================

Personal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address and name. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.

> ### Purposes and Legal Grounds:
> 
> (a) Garmin processes your email address because you use your email address and your password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is based on Garmin’s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.
> 
> (b) Garmin also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, apps or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile, and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on a Garmin website or app. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, apps or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy, and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other Garmin users.

The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your [preferences](https://www.garmin.com/account/ "MyPreferences") in your Garmin account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from Garmin are based on the preferences you provide in your Garmin account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your Garmin account, and any subscriptions included in your Garmin account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.

In some countries, third party providers may be used to generate the reporting required for the appropriate tax regulatory agency.

Categories of Recipients of Personal Data
=========================================

Your LiveTrack invitees:
------------------------

LiveTrack is a feature available on some Garmin devices that enables you to send a link to people of your choice that allows them to see the real-time location of your device. Because anyone with access to the link will be able to see the real-time location of your Garmin device, you should use caution in determining to whom you want to send the link and be sure that you trust them to not send the link to others whom you do not want to be able to view the location of your Garmin device.

Other service providers:
------------------------

Garmin uses cloud services from third parties such as Adobe and SendGrid to assist in sending emails. Those services track the activities associated with these emails, such as whether they were opened, whether links in the emails were clicked on, and whether purchases were made following clicks on those links. Garmin uses this data to analyze the level of engagement with its emails. Garmin uses third-party service providers to ship purchased products to customers and to help us better understand usage of Garmin Express and Garmin websites and apps. In some regions, Garmin uses a third-party service provider, Erply, to provide point-of-sale services for in-store purchases and another third party, Global Blue, to provide tax rebate paperwork for customers upon request. Garmin also uses a third-party service provider, VHT, to provide callback request functionality for customer support purposes.

Other disclosures:
------------------

We may disclose personal data about you to others: (a) if we have your valid consent to do so; (b) to comply with a valid subpoena, legal order, court order, legal process, or other legal obligation; (c) to enforce any of our terms and conditions or policies; or (d) as necessary to pursue available legal remedies or defend legal claims. We may also transfer your personal data to an affiliate, a subsidiary or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Garmin’s business, assets or stock, including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding, provided that any such entity that we transfer personal data to will not be permitted to process your personal data other than as described in this Privacy Policy without providing you notice and, if required by applicable laws, obtaining your consent.
