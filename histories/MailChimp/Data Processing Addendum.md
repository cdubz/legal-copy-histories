For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA shall not apply to instances where Mailchimp is the controller (as defined by EU Data Protection Law) unless otherwise described in Annex D hereto.

2.2 **Purpose limitation**. Mailchimp shall process Customer Data only in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions as set forth in this DPA, as necessary to comply with applicable law, or as otherwise agreed in writing ("Permitted Purposes"). The parties agree that the Agreement sets out Customer’s complete and final instructions to Mailchimp in relation to the processing of Customer Data, and processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between the parties.

2.3 **Prohibited data**. Customer will not provide (or cause to be provided) any Sensitive Data to Mailchimp for processing under the Agreement, and Mailchimp will have no liability whatsoever for Sensitive Data, whether in connection with a Security Incident or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA will not apply to Sensitive Data.

2.4 **Customer compliance**. Customer represents and warrants that (i) it has complied, and will continue to comply, with all applicable laws, including Data Protection Laws, in respect of its processing of Customer Data and any processing instructions it issues to Mailchimp; and (ii) it has provided, and will continue to provide, all notice and has obtained, and will continue to obtain, all consents and rights necessary under Data Protection Laws for Mailchimp to process Customer Data for the purposes described in the Agreement. Customer shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Customer Data and the means by which Customer acquired Customer Data. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for complying with all laws (including Data Protection Laws) applicable to any Campaigns (as defined in the Agreement) or other content created, sent or managed through the Service, including those relating to obtaining consents (where required) to send emails, the content of the emails and its email deployment practices.

2.5 **Lawfulness of Customer's instructions**. Customer will ensure that Mailchimp's processing of the Customer Data in accordance with Customer’s instructions will not cause Mailchimp to violate any applicable law, regulation, or rule, including, without limitation, Data Protection Laws. Mailchimp shall promptly notify Customer in writing, unless prohibited from doing so under EU Data Protection Laws, if it becomes aware or believes that any data processing instruction from Customer violates the GDPR or any UK implementation of the GDPR.

3\. Sub-processing
------------------

3.1 **Authorized Sub-processors**. Customer agrees that Mailchimp may engage Sub-processors to process Customer Data on Customer's behalf. The Sub-processors currently engaged by Mailchimp and authorized by Customer are available [here](/legal/subprocessors/). Mailchimp shall notify Customer if it adds or removes Sub-processors at least 10 days prior to any such changes if Customer opts in to receive such notifications by clicking [here](https://mailchimp.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=50c94565960030d65d982940e&id=dec9c21452).

3.2 **Sub-processor obligations**. Mailchimp shall: (i) enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations that provide at least the same level of protection for Customer Data as those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the service provided by such Sub-processor; and (ii) remain responsible for such Sub-processor’s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of such Sub-processor that cause Mailchimp to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.

4\. Security
------------

4.1 **Security Measures**. Mailchimp shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures that are designed to protect Customer Data from Security Incidents and designed to preserve the security and confidentiality of Customer Data in accordance with Mailchimp's security standards described in **Annex B** ("**Security Measures**").

4.2 **Confidentiality of processing**. Mailchimp shall ensure that any person who is authorized by Mailchimp to process Customer Data (including its staff, agents and subcontractors) shall be under an appropriate obligation of confidentiality (whether a contractual or statutory duty).

4.3 **Updates to Security Measures**. Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by Mailchimp relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Service meets Customer’s requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws. Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and that Mailchimp may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Service provided to Customer.

4.4 **Security Incident response**. Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Mailchimp shall: (i) notify Customer without undue delay, and where feasible, in any event no later than 48 hours from becoming aware of the Security Incident; (ii) provide timely information relating to the Security Incident as it becomes known or as is reasonably requested by Customer; and (iii) promptly take reasonable steps to contain and investigate any Security Incident. Mailchimp's notification of or response to a Security Incident under this Section 4.4 shall not be construed as an acknowledgment by Mailchimp of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.

4.5 **Customer responsibilities**. Notwithstanding the above, Customer agrees that except as provided by this DPA, Customer is responsible for its secure use of the Service, including securing its account authentication credentials, protecting the security of Customer Data when in transit to and from the Service, and taking any appropriate steps to securely encrypt or backup any Customer Data uploaded to the Service.

5\. Security Reports and Audits
-------------------------------

5.1 **Audit rights**. Mailchimp shall make available to Customer all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections by Customer in order to assess compliance with this DPA. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it shall exercise its audit rights under this DPA (including this Section 5.1 and where applicable, the SCCs) and any audit rights granted by Data Protection Laws, by instructing Mailchimp to comply with the audit measures described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 below.

5.2 **Security reports**. Customer acknowledges that Mailchimp is regularly audited against SSAE 16 and PCI standards by independent third party auditors and internal auditors respectively. Upon written request, Mailchimp shall supply (on a confidential basis) a summary copy of its most current audit report(s) ("**Report**") to Customer, so that Customer can verify Mailchimp's compliance with the audit standards against which it has been assessed and this DPA.

5.3 **Security due diligence**. In addition to the Report, Mailchimp shall respond to all reasonable requests for information made by Customer to confirm Mailchimp's compliance with this DPA, including responses to information security, due diligence, and audit questionnaires, by making additional information available regarding its information security program upon Customer’s written request to [privacy@mailchimp.com](mailto:privacy@mailchimp.com), provided that Customer shall not exercise this right more than once per calendar year.

6\. International Transfers
---------------------------

6.1 **Data center locations**. Subject to Section 6.2, Customer acknowledges that Mailchimp may transfer and process Customer Data to and in the United States and anywhere else in the world where Mailchimp, its Affiliates or its Sub-processors maintain data processing operations. Mailchimp shall at all times ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws and this DPA.

6.2 **Australian data**. To the extent that Mailchimp is a recipient of Customer Data protected by the Australian Privacy Law, the parties acknowledge and agree that Mailchimp may transfer such Customer Data outside of Australia as permitted by the terms agreed upon by the parties and subject to Mailchimp complying with this DPA and the Australian Privacy Law.

6.3 **European Data transfers**. To the extent that Mailchimp is a recipient of Customer Data protected by EU Data Protection Laws ("EU Data") in a country outside of Europe that is not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data (as described in applicable EU Data Protection Law), the parties agree to the following:

*   (a) **SCCs**: Mailchimp agrees to abide by and process EU Data in compliance with the SCCs in the form set out in Annex C. For the purposes of the descriptions in the SCCs, Mailchimp agrees that it is the "data importer" and Customer is the "data exporter" (notwithstanding that Customer may itself be an entity located outside Europe).
    
*   (b) **Privacy Shield**: Although Mailchimp does not rely on the EU-US Privacy Shield as a legal basis for transfers of Customer Data in light of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18, for as long as Mailchimp is self-certified to the Privacy Shield: (i) Mailchimp agrees to process EU Data in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) if Mailchimp is unable to comply with this requirement, Mailchimp shall inform Customer.
    

6.4 **Alternative transfer mechanism**. To the extent Mailchimp adopts an alternative data export mechanism (including any new version of or successor to the SCCs or Privacy Shield) for the transfer of EU Data not described in this DPA ("Alternative Transfer Mechanism"), the Alternative Transfer Mechanism shall apply instead of the transfer mechanisms described in this DPA (but only to the extent such Alternative Transfer Mechanism complies with applicable EU Data Protection Law and extends to the countries to which EU Data is transferred). In addition, if and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction or supervisory authority orders (for whatever reason) that the measures described in this DPA cannot be relied on to lawfully transfer EU Data (within the meaning of applicable EU Data Protection Law), Mailchimp may implement any additional measures or safeguards that may be reasonably required to enable the lawful transfer of EU Data.

7\. Return or Deletion of Data
------------------------------

**Deletion or return on termination**. Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Mailchimp shall (at Customer's election) delete or return to Customer all Customer Data (including copies) in its possession or control, except that this requirement shall not apply to the extent Mailchimp is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Customer Data, or to Customer Data it has archived on back-up systems, which Customer Data Mailchimp shall securely isolate, protect from any further processing and eventually delete in accordance with Mailchimp's deletion policies, except to the extent required by applicable law.

8\. Data Subject Rights and Cooperation
---------------------------------------

8.1 **Data subject requests**. As part of the Service, Mailchimp provides Customer with a number of self-service features, that Customer may use to retrieve, correct, delete or restrict the use of Customer Data, which Customer may use to assist it in connection with its obligations under the Data Protection Laws with respect to responding to requests from data subjects via Customer's account at no additional cost. In addition, Mailchimp shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, provide reasonable additional assistance to Customer to the extent possible to enable Customer to comply with its data protection obligations with respect to data subject rights under Data Protection Laws. In the event that any such request is made to Mailchimp directly, Mailchimp shall not respond to such communication directly except as appropriate (for example, to direct the data subject to contact Customer) or legally required, without Customer's prior authorization. If Mailchimp is required to respond to such a request, Mailchimp shall promptly notify Customer and provide Customer with a copy of the request unless Mailchimp is legally prohibited from doing so. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Agreement (including this DPA) shall restrict or prevent Mailchimp from responding to any data subject or data protection authority requests in relation to personal data for which Mailchimp is a controller.

8.2 **Data protection impact assessment**. To the extent required under applicable Data Protection Laws, Mailchimp shall (taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Mailchimp) provide all reasonably requested information regarding the Service to enable Customer to carry out data protection impact assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities as required by Data Protection Laws. Mailchimp shall comply with the foregoing by: (i) complying with Section 5 (Security Reports and Audits); (ii) providing the information contained in the Agreement, including this DPA; and (iii) if the foregoing sub-sections (i) and (ii) are insufficient for Customer to comply with such obligations, upon request, providing additional reasonable assistance (at Customer's expense).

9\. Jurisdiction-Specific Terms
-------------------------------

To the extent Mailchimp processes Customer Data originating from and protected by Data Protection Laws in one of the jurisdictions listed in Annex D, then the terms specified in Annex D with respect to the applicable jurisdiction(s) (“Jurisdiction-Specific Terms”) apply in addition to the terms of this DPA. In the event of any conflict or ambiguity between the Jurisdiction-Specific Terms and any other terms of this DPA, the applicable Jurisdiction-Specific Terms will take precedence, but only to the extent of the Jurisdiction-Specific Terms’ applicability to Mailchimp.

10\. Limitation of Liability
----------------------------

10.1 Each party’s and all of its Affiliates’ liability taken together in the aggregate arising out of or related to this DPA (including the SCCs) shall be subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability set forth in the Agreement.

2.  The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the Data Protection Law.
3.  The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).

_Clause 9_

_**Governing Law**_

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

_Clause 10_

_**Variation of the contract**_

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

_Clause 11_

_**Subprocessing**_

1.  The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.
2.  The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
3.  The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
4.  The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority.

_Clause 12_

_**Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services**_

1.  The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
2.  The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

The parties acknowledge that Clause 10 of the Clauses permits them to include additional business-related terms provided they do not contradict with the Clauses. Accordingly, this Appendix sets out the parties' interpretation of their respective obligations under specific Clauses identified below. Where a party complies with the interpretations set out in this Appendix, that party shall be deemed by the other party to have complied with its commitments under the Clauses.

**Clauses 4(h) and 8: Disclosure of these Clauses**

1.  Data exporter agrees that these Clauses constitute data importer's Confidential Information (as that term is defined in the Agreement) and may not be disclosed by data exporter to any third party without data importer's prior written consent unless permitted pursuant to the Agreement. This shall not prevent disclosure of these Clauses to a data subject pursuant to Clause 4(h) or a supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 8.

**Clause 5(a) and Clause 5(b): Suspension of data transfers and termination**

1.  The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of Clause 5(a), data importer may process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its documented instructions as set out in the DPA and that pursuant to the DPA, these instructions shall be the data exporter’s complete and final instructions.
2.  The parties acknowledge that if data importer cannot provide compliance in accordance with Clause 5(a) and/or Clause 5(b), the data importer agrees to promptly inform the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the affected parts of the Service in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
3.  If the data exporter intends to suspend the transfer of personal data and/or terminate the affected parts of the Service, it shall first provide notice to the data importer and provide data importer with a reasonable period of time to cure the non-compliance (“Cure Period”).
4.  In addition, the data exporter and data importer shall reasonably cooperate with each other during the Cure Period to agree what additional safeguards or other measures, if any, may be reasonably required to ensure the data importer's compliance with the Clauses and applicable data protection law.
5.  If, after the Cure Period, the data importer has not or cannot cure the non-compliance in accordance with the paragraphs 3 and 4 above, then the data exporter may suspend and/or terminate the affected part of the Service in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by the data exporter prior to suspension or termination).

**Clause 5(f): Audit**

1.  Data exporter acknowledges and agrees that it exercises its audit right under Clause 5(f) by instructing data importer to comply with the audit measures described in Section 5 (Security Reports and Audits) of the DPA.

**Clause 5(j): Disclosure of subprocessor agreements**

1.  The parties acknowledge the obligation of the data importer to send promptly a copy of any onward subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.
2.  The parties further acknowledge that, pursuant to subprocessor confidentiality restrictions, data importer may be restricted from disclosing onward subprocessor agreements to data exporter. Notwithstanding this, data importer shall use reasonable efforts to require any subprocessor it appoints to permit it to disclose the subprocessor agreement to data exporter.
3.  Even where data importer cannot disclose a subprocessor agreement to data exporter, the parties agree that, upon the request of data exporter, data importer shall (on a confidential basis) provide all information it reasonably can in connection with such subprocessing agreement to data exporter.

**Clause 6: Liability**

1.  Any claims brought under the Clauses shall be subject to the terms and conditions, including but not limited to, the exclusions and limitations set forth in the Agreement. In no event, shall any party limit its liability with respect to any data subject rights under these Clauses.

**Clause 11: Onward subprocessing**

1.  The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to FAQ II.1 in Article 29 Working Party Paper WP 176 entitled "FAQs in order to address some issues raised by the entry into force of the EU Commission Decision 2010/87/EU of 5 February 2010 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries under Directive 95/46/EC" the data exporter may provide a general consent to onward subprocessing by the data importer.
2.  Accordingly, data exporter provides a general consent to data importer, pursuant to Clause 11 of these Clauses, to engage onward subprocessors. Such consent is conditional on data importer’s compliance with the requirements set out in Section 3 (Sub-processing) of the DPA.

Annex D - Jurisdiction-Specific Terms
-------------------------------------

**Europe**:

1.  Objection to Sub-processors. Customer may object in writing to Mailchimp’s appointment of a new Sub-processor within five (5) calendar days of receiving notice in accordance with Section 3.1 of DPA, provided that such objection is based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. In such event, the parties shall discuss such concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached, Mailchimp will, at its sole discretion, either not appoint such Sub-processor, or permit Customer to suspend or terminate the affected Service in accordance with the termination provisions in the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by Customer prior to suspension or termination).
2.  Government data access requests. As a matter of general practice, Mailchimp does not voluntarily provide government agencies or authorities (including law enforcement) with access to or information about Mailchimp accounts (including Customer Data). If Mailchimp receives a compulsory request (whether through a subpoena, court order, search warrant, or other valid legal process) from any government agency or authority (including law enforcement) for access to or information about a Mailchimp account (including Customer Data) belonging to a Customer whose primary contact information indicates the Customer is located in Europe, Mailchimp shall: (i) inform the government agency that Mailchimp is a processor of the data; (ii) attempt to redirect the agency to request the data directly from Customer; and (iii) notify Customer via email sent to Customer’s primary contact email address of the request to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. As part of this effort, Mailchimp may provide Customer’s primary and billing contact information to the agency. Mailchimp shall not be required to comply with this paragraph 2 if it is legally prohibited from doing so, or it has a reasonable and good-faith belief that urgent access is necessary to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to any individual, public safety, or Mailchimp’s property, Sites, or Service.

**UK**:

1.  For the avoidance of doubt, when European Union law ceases to apply to the UK upon the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and until such time as the UK is deemed to provide adequate protection for personal data (within the meaning of applicable EU Data Protection Law) then to the extend Mailchimp processes (or causes to be processed) any Customer Data protected by EU Data Protection Law applicable to EEA and Switzerland in the United Kingdom, Mailchimp shall process such Customer Data in compliance with the SCCs or any applicable Alternative Transfer Mechanism implemented in accordance with Section 6.3 and 6.4 of this DPA.

3.  For this “California” section of Annex D only, “Permitted Purposes” shall include processing Customer Data only for the purposes described in this DPA and in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions as set forth in this DPA, as necessary to comply with applicable law, as otherwise agreed in writing, including, without limitation, in the Agreement, or as otherwise may be permitted for “service providers” under the CCPA.
4.  Mailchimp’s obligations regarding data subject requests, as described in Section 8 (Data Subject Rights and Cooperation) of this DPA, apply to Consumer’s rights under the CCPA.
5.  Notwithstanding any use restriction contained elsewhere in this DPA, Mailchimp shall process Customer Data only to perform the Mailchimp Services, for the Permitted Purposes and/or in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions, except where otherwise required by applicable law.
6.  Mailchimp may de-identify or aggregate Customer Data as part of performing the Service specified in this DPA and the Agreement.
7.  Where Sub-processors process the personal data of Customer contacts, Mailchimp takes steps to ensure that such Sub-processors are Service Providers under the CCPA with whom Mailchimp has entered into a written contract that includes terms substantially similar to this DPA or are otherwise exempt from the CCPA’s definition of “sale”. Mailchimp conducts appropriate due diligence on its Sub-processors.

**Canada**:

1.  Mailchimp takes steps to ensure that Mailchimp's Sub-processors, as described in Section 3 (Sub-processing) of the DPA, are third parties under PIPEDA, with whom Mailchimp has entered into a written contract that includes terms substantially similar to this DPA.
