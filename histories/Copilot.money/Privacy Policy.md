8.         **California Residents.**

California law requires us to disclose how we respond to web browser Do Not Track signals. Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard for responding to Do Not Track signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

California law provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. If you are a California resident, this section describes your rights and explains how to exercise those rights.

**_A.         Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights._**

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:

· The categories of personal information we collected about you.

· The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.

· Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.

· The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.

· The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).

· If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:

· sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and

· disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.

**_B.         Deletion Request Rights_**

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:

· Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.

· Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

· Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.

· Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.

· Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).

· Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.

· Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.

· Comply with a legal obligation.

· Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

**_C.         Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights_**

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

· Calling us at 504-475-1474.

· Visiting [https://www.copilot.money/ccpa.html](https://www.copilot.money/ccpa.html)

Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

· Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.

· Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

**_D.         Response Timing and Format_**

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

**_E.         Non-Discrimination_**

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your California privacy rights. Unless permitted by California law, we will not:

· Deny you goods or services.

· Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.

· Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.

· Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
